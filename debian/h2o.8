.SH NAME
h2o \- optimized HTTP/1.x, HTTP/2 server
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B h2o
.RI [ options ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
H2O is a performance-optimized HTTP/1.x and HTTP/2 web server. Designed from
ground-up, the server takes full advantage of HTTP/2 features including
prioritized content serving and server push.

This manual page describes the options supported by the \fBh2o\fP command. Note
that H2O should in most cases be run as a system service (through a
.BR systemd (1)
service or an initscript).
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-conf\fR FILE
Configuration file (default: \fI\,/etc/h2o/h2o.conf\/\fP)
.TP
\fB\-m\fR, \fB\-\-mode\fR \fImode\fP
\fImode\fP specifies one of the following modes:
.RS
.TP
\fBworker\fR
the \fBh2o\fR process will stay in the foreground and handle all incoming
connections itself (default).
.TP
\fBmaster\fR
\fBh2o\fR will be started using
the \fB/usr/share/h2o/start_server\fP helper; in this mode the
\fBstart_server\fR process will stay in the foreground and spawn an \fBh2o\fP
worker process for handling incoming connections. \fBSIGHUP\fP can be sent to
the master process to reconfigure or upgrade the server without service downtime.
.TP
\fBdaemon\fR
spawns a \fBmaster\fP process in the background and exits. \fBerror\-log\fP must
be configured when using this mode, as all errors are logged to the error log
instead of output to standard error.
.TP
\fBtest\fR
tests the configuration and exits
.RE
.TP
\fB\-t\fR, \fB\-\-test\fR
Synonym of `\-\-mode=test`
